Common Relationship Mistakes 
	- Everything Knows Everything	
	- Bidirectional relationships everwhere 
	- Premature Complexity 

Wrap Up
	- Relationships express responsibility 
	- ownership Matters 
	- Design before code 
	
Object Collaboration and the Law of Demeter 

	1. Objects collaborate by: 
		- Calling Methods 
		- Passing messages 
		- Delegating work 	
		
Example: 
	public class TaskList {
	
		private List<Task> tasks = new ArrayList<>(); 
		
		// uses new class of Task to make a new task to manage 
		public void addTask(String title) {
			tasks.add(new Task(title); // manages the other class Task() here
		}
		
		public void remove(Task task) {
			tasks.remove(task); 
		}
	}

Bad Collabration Example: 

	// too many dependices 
	task.getTaskList().getTasks().add(task); 
	
Why This is a Problem 
	- High coupling 
	- Breaks encapsulation 
	- Fragile design 
	
Mediator (Design Pattern - Multiple Aircraft Towers - High Coupling)
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern 
	- Ex. Aircraft towers that connect to other aircraft towers 

Law of Demeter 
	- An Object should only talk to
		- Itself 
		- it's field 
		- sits method parameters 
		- objects it creates 
	- This helps Reduce Coupling and Increase maintainability 
	
	- A given object should only talk to its immediate friends, not strangers
	
	Encapsulation Enforced 
		- Hide internal structure 
		- Expose meaningful behavior 
		- Reduce knowledge leaks 
		
		Ex. 
		// expose it privately and hidden: 
		task.add(task); 
		
	Coupling 
		- Degree of dependency between classes 
		- High coupling is risky 
		- Low coupling is resilient 
		
	Cohesion 
		- How focused a class is 
		- High cohesion is desirable 
		- One clear purpose per class 
		
	Collaboration Refactoring 
		- Move logic closer to data 
		- Replace chains with methods 
		- Let objects do their job 
		
	Wrap Up
		- Objects collaborate via messages 
		- Law of Demeter reduces coupling 
		- Good design hides structure 
	
Starting Design 
	- Task 
		- Store Task data
	- TaskList 
		- Manages Tasks 
	- TaskManager 
		- Coordinates actions 
		taskManager.completeTask(taskId); 
		
Example Application: 
	public class Task {
		
		private String description; 
		private boolean isCompleted; 
		private int id = 0; 
		
		public Task(String description, boolean isCompleted, int id) {
			this.description = description; 
			this.isCompleted = isCompleted; 
			this.id  		 = id; 
		}
		
		private int getId() {
			return id; 
		}
		
		public boolean isCompleted() {
			return isCompleted;
		}
		
		public boolean markCompleted(boolean markCompleted) {
			
			if(isCompleted == false) {return false;}
			this.isCompleted = markCompleted
			
			return true; 
		}
