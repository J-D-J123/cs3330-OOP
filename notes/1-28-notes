Private 
	- Protects invariants 
	- Reduces Coupling 
	- Enables Safe refactoring 
	
Change Public to Private 
	- Bit better but not perfect 
	
Protected Visibility 
	- Animals -> Mamals -> Reptilies 
	- Mamals -> Dog -> Tiger
	- Reptilies 
	- Animals -> Protected Walk() -> now everyone can walk under that field 
	
Common Access Modifer Mistakes 
	- Making Everything Public 
	- Using protected instead of composition 
	- Exposing fields directly
