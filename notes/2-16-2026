Interfaces 
	- Define behavior contracts 
	- No state (mostly)
	- Support multiple inheritance of behavior 
	- They are NOT CLASSES!
	
Interface Example 
	Ex. 
	
	public interface Payable {
		double calculatePay(); 	
	}
	
Interface vs Abstract Class 
	- Interface: what you can do 
	- Abstract class: what you are 
	- Prefer interfaces for flexibility 
	
Example with multithreading 
	- Class Thread 
	- Interface Runnable 
	
	- Class Task 	// have two options you can use the class thread or the interface 

Which should be a interface?
	- Flyable 		// implyes a behavior (yes this can be a interface)
	- Bird 			// nope more of a class not a interface
	- Serializable  // implys a behavior (yes this can be a interface)
