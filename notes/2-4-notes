Refactoring Result 
	- Clear responsibilites 
	- Safer Object 
	- Better Design 
	- Studied in Research to refactor efficently 
	
UML Updated View
	- Task with constructor 
	- Private fields 
	- Public behavior 
	
Key Takeaways
	- Classes protect their state 
	- Constructors enforce correctness 
	- Immutability is powerful 
	
Object Relationships and Collaboration 
	- Objects rarely live alone 
	- Classes form relationships 
	- Design about collaboration 
	- Focus: how objects connect and communicate 

Big Idea 
	- Objects solve problems by 
		1. knowing things 
		2. doing things 
		3. asking other objects for help 

Classes: 
	+ Task()
		- String task 
	TaskList()
		- Task()
	TaskManager()
		- TaskList()

Classes Do Not Exist in Isolation 
	- A Task belongs to a TaskList
	- A Student enrolls in Courses 
	- An Order contains Items 
	
What Is a Relationship?
	- A relationship describes: 
		1. how objects are connected 
		2. who knows about whom 
		3. who depends on whom 
		
Types of Relationships We Care About 
	1. Association
		- one knows the other 
	2. Aggression 
		- not tied together (loose relationship) 
	3. Composition 
		- strong ownership, parts cannot exist independently 

Choosing the Right Relationship
	- Ask yourself: 
		1. Who owns whom?
		2. Who creates whom?
		3. Who contorls lifetime?
