Collaboration Smells (code smells)
	- Long method chains 
	- God objects 
	- Objects doing other's jobs 
	
Refactoring Checklist
	 - Can I move this method?
	 - Does this object know too much?
	 	- is it your bussiness to know everthing?
	 - Is this relationship necessary? 
	 
What You Just Learned 
	- Relationships shape design 
	- Collaboration drives behavior 
	- Encapsulation is enforced through structure 
	
Up Next!
	- Inheritance 
	- Interfaces 
	- Polymorphism 
	- When not to inherit 
	
Polymorphism
	- Reusing behavior responsibly 
	- Replacing conditionals with polymorphism 
	- Designing for extension 
	- Understanding when inheritance helps and when it hurts 
	
Why We Even Want Inheritance 
	- Avoid duplication 
	- Share a common behavior 
	- Model "is a" relationship
	
What Inheritance Gives You 
	- Field and method reuse 
	- Method overriding 
	- Subtype polymorphism 
	
Method @Overriding 
	- Change meaning of a method 

The "Is A" Test 
	Class Animal 
		- String name 
			+eat()
			+sleep()
	Class Dog
			+bark()
			
	- A dog is a animal 
	- A car is not a wheel 
	- A squre is cannot bark
	
	
Basic Example of Inheritance
	Class Animal 
		- String name
		
	Class Dog	
	Class Cat 
	
	
	public class Animal {
	
		private String name; 
		protecte int   aget; 
		
		public Animal(String name) {
		
			this.name = name; 
			System.out.println("Animal Object with "+ name + "Created");  
		}
	}
	
	public class Dog extends Animal {
	
		public Dog(String name) {
		
			super(name); 
			super.age; 
			
			// System.out.println("Dog Object Created");
		}
	}
